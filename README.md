This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Some feautres of this project are :
- All the styling is done using styled components, these provide automatic classNames and makes the styling more optimized. Styled components use Stylus in backend that goes parallel with any precompiled styles like SASS/SCSS

- There is a single page in the app at the root, and that contains the required implementation
